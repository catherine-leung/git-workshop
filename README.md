# git-workshop

This git workshop was created to help those new to git/github better understanding of the basics.  It is split into several activities.

* [Activity 1](https://github.com/catherine-leung/git-workshop/blob/main/activity1.md) - helps establish an understanding of what git is and how it works using github
* [Activity 2](https://github.com/catherine-leung/git-workshop/blob/main/activity2.md) - repeat of activity 1 on the command line to connect git commands with mental model of git.
* [Activity 3](https://github.com/catherine-leung/git-workshop/blob/main/activity3.md) - working with remotes, how do you transfer changes to and from github.
* [Activity 4]() - working with groups (coming later)
